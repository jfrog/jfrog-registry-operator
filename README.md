## Setting up JFrogâ€™s AssumeRole Capabilities in AWS

Follow the [official documentation](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-installation-setup-documentation/passwordless-access-for-amazon-eks) for detailed instructions on detailed information and AWS configuration required to run the JFrog Registry Operator.

The integration of AWS Assume Role and JFrog Access presents a powerful solution that enables AWS Identity and Access Management  (IAM) users to temporarily assume permissions to perform actions in a secure and controlled manner. The solution enhances Kubernetes Secrets Management by automating token rotation, enhancing access controls, and seamlessly integrating JFrog Artifactory into the AWS environment

### AssumeRole JFrog Architecture & Deployment

The following diagram shows the basic architecture of how AssumeRole integrates with JFrog Access to provide enhanced access control:

If you are interested in making the move from vulnerable manual secret handling to secure automated secret management, then your journey towards a more secure and seamless containerized future begins here. See how quickly this powerful capability can be deployed by checking out our [step-by-step installation and configuration guide](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-installation-setup-documentation/passwordless-access-for-amazon-eks).

## Install operator using helm chart - Ignore if you already installed using Setting up JFrogâ€™s AssumeRole Capabilities in AWS

```bash
# Get the latest [Helm release](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) Note: (only V3 is supported)
# before installing JFrog helm charts, you need to add the [JFrog helm repository](https://charts.jfrog.io) to your helm client.
helm repo add jfrog https://charts.jfrog.io

# update the helm repo
helm repo update

# decide on the namespace and kubernetes service account name you will want to create
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="<service account name>"
export ANNOTATIONS="<Role annotation for service account>" # Example: eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/jfrog-operator-role
export NAMESPACE="jfrog-operator"

# install JFrog secret rotator operator
helm upgrade --install secretrotator jfrog/jfrog-registry-operator --set "serviceAccount.name=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" --set serviceAccount.annotations=${ANNOTATIONS}  --namespace  ${NAMESPACE} --create-namespace
```

Once operator is in running state, configure `artifactoryUrl`, `refreshTime`, `namespaceSelector`, and `secretMetadata` in [secretrotator.yaml](https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-registry-operator/blob/master/charts/jfrog-registry-operator/examples/secretrotator.yaml)

Sample Manifest:

```
apiVersion: apps.jfrog.com/v1alpha1
kind: SecretRotator
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: secretrotators.apps.jfrog.com
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: secretrotator
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: artifactory-secrets-rotator
  name: secretrotator
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      kubernetes.io/metadata.name: jfrog-operator
  generatedSecrets:
  - secretName: token-imagepull-secret
    secretType: docker
  - secretName: token-generic-secret
    secretType: generic
  artifactoryUrl: "artifactory.example.com"
  refreshTime: 1m
  security:
    enabled: false
    secretNamespace:
    ## NOTE: You can provide either a ca.pem or ca.crt. But make sure that key needs to same as ca.crt or ca.pem in secret
    certificateSecretName:
    insecureSkipVerify: false
```
Note: Currently spec.secretName is supported but going forward this will be deprecated soon.

Apply the secretrotator mainfest:

```
kubectl apply -f /charts/jfrog-registry-operator/examples/secretrotator.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

### Uninstalling JFrog Secret Rotator operator

```shell
# Uninstall the secretrotator using the following command
helm uninstall secretrotator -n ${NAMESPACE}

# Uninstall the secretrotator object (path should be pointing to the secretrotator.yaml)
kubectl delete -f secretrotator.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE}

# Remove the CRD from the cluster
kubectl delete crd secretrotators.apps.jfrog.com
```

### Check Resources in your cluster

```shell
# For secrets in your namespace
kubectl get secrets -n ${NAMESPACE}

# For operator pod in your namespace
kubectl get po -n ${NAMESPACE}

# For SecretRotator
kubectl get SecretRotator
```
